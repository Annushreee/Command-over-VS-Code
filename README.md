Just wrapped up my hands-on journey through Big Data Analytics — a deep dive filled with insights, challenges, and continuous learning. From statistical foundations to machine learning model evaluations, this experience helped solidify both theoretical understanding and practical skills.

Here’s what went down:
▪️ Counted the Uniques and Caught the Duplicates
▪️ Explored the shape of data with Normal Distribution
▪️ Built and evaluated Naive Bayes models with K-Fold Cross Validation
▪️ Performed Z-Test, T-Test, and ANOVA for real-world hypothesis testing
▪️ Implemented both Logistic and Linear Regression from scratch
▪️ Got hands-on with the Weka AI Tool
▪️ Visualized data relationships with Co-relation Matrices
▪️ Evaluated performance using Confusion Matrices
